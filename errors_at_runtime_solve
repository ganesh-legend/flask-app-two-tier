ERROR 1)
When you run the application in network or docker-compose.yml file ,
then it will throw you an error that access has denied to user 'admin'@'%' on myDB.

solution:---->

On your EC2 instance connected terminal, first check both containers are running properly or not. If yes,
then on the terminal , type the following commands.

1)  $ docker exec -it mysql_container_name bash




Now you would have come inside container. Type here following command to connect to mysql database.

2)  bash-4.2# mysql -u root -p

You will be asked for password and enter password "admin" without double quotes ðŸ˜„



    
Now you will come to mysql interface. type following commands.

3)  mysql> show databases;

It will show you all the databases available. But our database is "myDB" which is not present in list.
So, we need to create it. Type following commands

4)  mysql> create database myDB;



Now we have to create table inside it called "messages". Type below command for it.

5)  mysql>  use myDB;

6)  mysql>  CREATE TABLE messages (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message TEXT);




Now grant the permissions on myDB database and it's table "messages" to admin user.

7) mysql>  grant all on myDB.* to 'admin'@'%';

Now refresh the application page on website. You are good to go.
Thanks....ðŸ˜Ž
